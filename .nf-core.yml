  description: "This pipeline takes a drug response prediction model architecture
    as input and evaluates its performance by using custom training, validation, and
    test sets. It compares it against existing deep learning models and baseline models.
    Additionally, it tests the model for overfitting, consistency, robustness, and
    generalization. "
